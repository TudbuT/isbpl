# isbpl
Improved Stack-Based Programming Language

Incomplete, not currently compilable!

JS Bootstrap is very, very, very DIRTY! Do not use it to run anything but 
the compiler until the compiler is fully finished and can compile itself!!!
A pre-compiled compiler will be added as bootstrap as soon as possible.
